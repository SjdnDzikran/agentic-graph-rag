Here are some CVEs related to buffer overflow weaknesses:

*   **CVE-2016-9603**: A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in QEMU's Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA emulator's VNC display driver support before 2.9. A privileged user/process inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process or, potentially, execute arbitrary code on the host with privileges of the QEMU process. (CVSS score: 9.9)
*   **CVE-2017-14444**: An exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Insteon Hub running firmware version 1012.
