The goal is to adapt and re-implement the Agentic Graph RAG approach (see the first paper) specifically for vulnerability assessment (finding, scoring, prioritizing, and explaining software vulnerabilities).
- Use ontology and KGs from Cybersecurity Knowledge Graphs (see the second paper)
Use Agentic Graph RAG to:
- Rank vulnerabilities by severity or exploitability.
- Generate short risk assessment summaries and mitigation advice.
- Compare results with: Normal RAG (no KG), Traditional CVSS scoring
- Provide evaluation results in a simple table or chart (accuracy, ranking, speed).
- Show 3 real vulnerability examples with your system’s outputs.
- Upload your code, data to GitHub.
