## Abstract

This paper introduces an evolving cybersecurity knowledge graph that integrates and links critical information on real-world vulnerabilities, weaknesses and attack patterns from various publicly available sources. Cybersecurity constitutes a particularly interesting domain for the development of a domain-specific public knowledge graph, particularly due to its highly dynamic landscape characterized by time-critical, dispersed, and heterogeneous information. To build and continually maintain a knowledge graph, we provide and describe an integrated set of resources, including vocabularies derived from well-established standards in the cybersecurity domain, an ETL workflow that updates the knowledge graph as new information becomes available, and a set of services that provide integrated access through multiple interfaces. The resulting semantic resource offers comprehensive and integrated up-to-date instance information to security researchers and professionals alike. Furthermore, it can be easily linked to locally available information, as we demonstrate by means of two use cases in the context of vulnerability assessment and intrusion detection.

**Keywords:** Knowledge graph · Cybersecurity · Security vocabularies · Security standards · Security analysis · Intrusion detection

## 1. Introduction

Security and privacy have become key issues in today's modern societies characterized by a strong dependence on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Security incidents, such as ransomware and data theft, are widely reported in the media and illustrate the ongoing struggle to protect ICT systems. In their mission to secure systems, security professionals rely on a wealth of information such as known and newly identified vulnerabilities, weaknesses, threats, and attack patterns. Such information is collected and published by, e.g., Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), research institutions, government agencies, and industry experts. 

Whereas a lot of relevant information is still shared informally as text, initiatives to make security information available in well-defined structured formats, largely driven by MITRE and NIST, have made significant progress and resulted in a wide range of standards. These standards define high-level schemas for cybersecurity information and have resulted in various structured lists that are available for browsing on the web and for download in heterogeneous structured formats. 

This wealth of cybersecurity data is highly useful, but the current approach for sharing it is associated with several limitations:

1. **Isolation:** Individual entities and data sets remain isolated and cannot easily be referenced and linked from other data sets
2. **Semantic ambiguity:** Whereas the governed schemas provide a well-defined structure, the semantics are not as well-defined, limiting the potential for integration and automated machine interpretation
3. **Information overload:** The resulting abundance of data raises challenges for security analysts and professionals who have to keep track of all the available sources and identify relevant information within them

### Our Proposal

We propose that integrating cybersecurity information into a regularly updated, public knowledge graph can overcome these limitations and open up exciting opportunities for cybersecurity research and practice. This makes it possible not only to query public cybersecurity information, but also to use it to contextualize local information.

As we illustrate with two example use cases in this paper, this facilitates applications such as:
- **Improved vulnerability assessment** by automatically determining which new vulnerabilities affect a given infrastructure
- **Improved incident response** through better contextualization of intrusion detection alerts

### Main Contributions

Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:

**For cybersecurity research and practice:**
- We advance the state of the art by providing an integrated up-to-date view on cybersecurity knowledge in a semantically explicit representation
- We provide tools and services to query and make use of this interlinked knowledge graph

**From a semantic web research perspective:**
- We illustrate how Linked Data principles can be applied to combine local and public knowledge in a highly dynamic environment characterized by fast-changing, dispersed, and heterogeneous information
- We develop an ETL pipeline that integrates newly available structured data from public sources into the knowledge graph, involving acquisition, extraction, lifting, linking, and validation steps

### Provided Resources

We provide the following resources (available at https://w3id.org/sepses/cyber-kg):

1. **Vocabularies** for the rich representation and interlinking of security-related information based on five well-established standards in the cybersecurity domain
2. **Comprehensive SEPSES Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph (KG)** with detailed instance data (36,594,388 triples as of July 2, 2019)
3. **ETL workflow** published as open source that updates the knowledge graph as new information becomes available
4. **Website** (https://sepses.ifs.tuwien.ac.at) that provides documentation, status information, and pointers to the various access mechanisms
5. **Services** to access the data:
   - SPARQL endpoint
   - Triple pattern fragments interface
   - Linked Data interface
   - Download options for the whole data set and various subsets

This semantic approach can provide a foundation for tools and services that support security analysts in applying external security knowledge and efficiently navigating dynamic security information. Ultimately, this should contribute towards improved cybersecurity knowledge sharing and increased situational awareness, both in large organizations with dedicated security experts who are often overwhelmed by information, and in smaller organizations that lack resources for specialized tools and experts.

## 2. Related Work

Various information security standards, taxonomies, vocabularies, and ontologies have been developed in academia, industry, and government agencies. These fall into two broad categories:

1. Standard data schemas for information sharing in the cybersecurity domain
2. Higher-level conceptualizations of security knowledge

### 2.1 Standard Data Schemas

Efficient information exchange requires common standards, particularly in highly diverse and dynamic domains such as cybersecurity. A set of standards has emerged that define the syntax of description languages for structured cybersecurity information and the semantics associated with those descriptions in natural language. Some standards are driven by traditional standardization bodies such as ISO, ITU, IEEE or IETF. The majority, however, are contributed by open source communities or entities such as MITRE, a not-for-profit research and development cooperation.

Salient examples for information sharing standards integrated in our knowledge graph include:

- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):** For publicly known vulnerabilities
- **CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification):** For known attack patterns used by adversaries
- **CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration):** For software security weaknesses
- **CPE (Common Platform Enumeration):** For encoding names of IT products and platforms
- **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):** For vulnerability scoring

These standards are widely used by security practitioners and integrated into security products and services, serving as important reference points for research.

### 2.2 Security Ontologies

A related line of academic research aims at high-level conceptualization of information security knowledge, resulting in numerous ontologies that typically revolve around core concepts such as asset, threat, vulnerability, and countermeasure. The resulting security ontologies are typically scoped for particular application domains (e.g., risk management, incident management).

**Notable Examples:**

- The high-level ontology developed by Obrst et al. mainly focuses on malware and aspects such as actors, victims, infrastructure, and capabilities
- Oltramari et al. introduce an ontological cyber security framework comprising:
  - A top-level ontology based on DOLCE
  - A mid-level ontology with security concepts (e.g., threat, attacker, vulnerability, countermeasure)
  - A domain ontology of cyber operations including defensive and offensive actions

**Recent Initiatives:**

- Various initiatives aimed at developing security ontologies covering the standard schemas, including ontologies for CVE vulnerabilities
- Ulicny et al. transform XML schemas from standards like STIX, CAPEC, CVE and CybOX into OWL ontology, integrating external information on persons, IP addresses, geographic entities, and "killchain" phases
- The STUCCO project outlines an approach for a cybersecurity knowledge graph integrating both structured and unstructured data sources
- Syed et al. create a Unified Cybersecurity Ontology (UCO) that aligns CAPEC, CVE, CWE, STIX, TAXII and Att&ck
- The Cyber Intelligence Ontology offers classes, properties and restrictions on many industry standards

### Gap in Existing Work

A review of related work shows that:
- Although basic concepts in the cybersecurity domain have been formalized repeatedly, no model has emerged as a standard
- Proposed high-level conceptualizations typically lack concrete instance information
- Many standards exist for cybersecurity information sharing with information published in various structured formats
- **However:** There is no integrated view on this scattered, heterogeneous information

Each application making use of published data must parse and interpret each source individually, making reuse, machine interpretation, and integration with local data difficult. Our evolving cybersecurity knowledge graph provides an integrated perspective to fill this gap.

## 3. Knowledge Graph Construction and Evolution

To construct and regularly update the SEPSES Cybersecurity KG, we define:
1. A set of vocabularies (Section 3.1)
2. An architecture for initial ingestion and incremental updating (Section 3.2)

Publication via Linked Data (LD), Triple Pattern Fragments (TPF), a SPARQL endpoint, and RDF dumps are covered in Section 4.

### 3.1 Conceptualization and Vocabularies

#### Design Approach

We started with a survey and found that the vast majority of conceptualizations described in the literature are not available online. Those that were available did not provide sufficiently detailed classes and properties to represent all information available in the cybersecurity repositories we target.

We opted for a **bottom-up approach** starting from well-established industry data sources. Our main design goals:

1. **Completeness:** Include complete information from original data sources to make the knowledge graph self-contained
2. **Structural similarity:** Keep the RDF model structurally similar to original data models for easy navigation by users familiar with original sources
3. **Documentation alignment:** Easily refer to original documentation and examples in the vocabularies

#### Integrated Security Information Repositories

Our schema covers the following repositories:

##### CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
- **Purpose:** Industry standard providing identifiers for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities
- **Integration:** Also includes NVD (National U.S. Vulnerability Database) enrichment
- **Representation:** `CVE` class with properties:
  - Data type properties: `cve:cveId`, `cve:description`, `cve:issued`, `cve:modified`
  - Object properties linking to:
    - Affected products (`cve:hasCPE`)
    - Vulnerable configurations (`cve:hasVulnerableConfiguration`)
    - Impact scores (`cve:hasCVSS`)
    - Related weaknesses (`cve:hasCWE`)
    - External references (`cve:hasReference`)

##### CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
- **Purpose:** Quantitative model describing characteristics and impacts of IT vulnerabilities
- **Integration:** CVSS scores from NVD
- **Representation:** Three metric classes:
  - `CVSSBaseMetric`
  - `CVSSTemporalMetric`
  - `CVSSEnvironmentalMetric`

##### CPE (Common Platform Enumeration)
- **Purpose:** Structured naming scheme for IT systems, software, and packages
- **Integration:** CPE Dictionary based on CPE 2.3 specification
- **Representation:** `CPE` class with:
  - Reference to product information (`cpe:hasProduct`)
  - Product properties: name, version, update, edition, language, etc.
  - Vendor modeling (`cpe:hasVendor`)

##### CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)
- **Purpose:** Community-developed list of common software security weaknesses
- **Representation:** `CWE` class with:
  - Data type properties: `cwe:id`, `cwe:name`, `cwe:description`, `cwe:status`
  - Object properties linking to:
    - Applicable platforms (`cwe:hasApplicablePlatform`)
    - Attack patterns (`cwe:hasCAPEC`)
    - Consequences (`cwe:hasCommonConsequence`)
    - Related weaknesses/hierarchy (`cwe:hasRelatedWeakness`)
    - Potential mitigations (`cwe:hasPotentialMitigation`)

##### CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification)
- **Purpose:** Dictionary of known attack patterns used by adversaries
- **Representation:** `CAPEC` class with:
  - Data type properties: `capec:id`, `capec:name`, `capec:likelihoodOfAttack`, `capec:description`
  - Object properties linking to:
    - Consequences (`capec:hasConsequences`)
    - Required skills (`capec:hasSkillRequired`)
    - Attack prerequisites (`capec:prerequisites`)
    - Attack consequences (`capec:hasConsequence`)

Most data sets define identifiers for key entities (vulnerabilities, weaknesses, attack patterns) and reuse concepts from other standards (e.g., CPE names and CVSS scores within CVE). We leverage these references to link the data.

### 3.2 ETL Process

The architecture (Figure 2) illustrates the overall ETL process for continuously updating the cybersecurity knowledge graph.

#### Data Acquisition

- **Sources:** Various sources providing data for download in heterogeneous formats (CSV, XML, JSON)
- **Update frequency:** Varies by source (e.g., CVE typically updates once every two hours)
- **Process:** ETL engine regularly polls for updates and ingests latest versions

#### Resource Extraction

- **Tools used:**
  - caRML engine for transforming original source files from various formats
  - Apache Jena for transforming raw RDF data into final ontology structure
- **Approach evolution:**
  - Initially developed RML transformation mappings with caRML-specific features
  - Restructured into generic RML mappings to address performance issues
  - **Result:** Dramatically improved performance (some operations reduced from ~1 hour to <1 minute)
- **ID generation:**
  - Straightforward for sources with established ID systems (CWE, CVE, CAPEC, CVSS)
  - For CPE: Used XPath functions to clean and produce unique names from composite naming elements

#### Entity Linking and Validation

- **Linking process:** Create direct links between associated resources based on common identifiers
  - Example: CWE weaknesses reference CAPEC attack patterns
  - For CPE: Deploy identical XPath functions across sources to ensure correct linking
- **Validation:**
  - SHACL validation ensures necessary properties are included for each individual
  - Validates correct resource linking
  - Handles missing references by logging and creating temporary resources
  - **Challenge addressed:** References to non-existent or no-longer-available identifiers

#### Data Storage

- **Storage:** Triple store
- **Statistics generated:**
  - Parsing time
  - Parsing status (success or fail)
  - Instance counts
  - Link counts
  - Generation time
- **Automation:** Bash scripts execute at regular intervals to trigger knowledge generation and storage
- **Current scale:** More than 500,000 instances and 36 million triples

#### Knowledge Graph Statistics (As of July 2, 2019)

| Dataset | Axioms | Classes | Object Properties | Data Properties | Individuals |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| CVE | 68 | 7 | 6 | 8 | 123,005 |

## 5. Use Cases

We illustrate the applicability of the cybersecurity knowledge graph through two example scenarios.

### 5.1 Vulnerability Assessment

In security management, identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing vulnerabilities is a key activity and necessary precondition for threat mitigation and successful protection of resources. The Vulnerability Assessment (VA) process can involve:
- **Active techniques:** Scanning and penetration testing
- **Passive techniques:** Monitoring public data sources for relevant vulnerabilities and threats

Keeping track of all relevant information and determining relevance and implications for system assets is challenging for security professionals. We illustrate how the developed knowledge graph can support security analysts by linking organization-specific asset information to a continuously updated stream of known vulnerabilities.

#### Setting

We modeled a simplified example network comprising:
- **Three Hosts:** Two workstations, one server
- **Network Devices**
- **IT Assets hierarchy:** All hardware components are subclasses of `ITAssets`
- **Software modeling:** `hasInstalledProduct` property links hosts to CPE specifications
- **Data Assets:** Includes classification (public, private, restricted) and storage location (`storedOn Host`) for impact severity assessment

In practice, system modeling can be supported by existing IT asset/software discovery and inventory tools.

#### Query 1: Identifying Vulnerable Assets

Once a local system model is created, vulnerability information can be applied and contextualized via federated SPARQL query. Security analysts can identify all known vulnerabilities potentially applying to each host based on installed software.

**Example Query:**
```sparql
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX asset: <http://w3id.org/sepses/vocab/bgk/assetKnowledge#>
PREFIX cve: <http://w3id.org/sepses/vocab/ref/cve#>
PREFIX cpe: <http://w3id.org/sepses/vocab/ref/cpe#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?hostName str(?ip) as ?IP ?product
  (group_concat(?cveId) as ?cveIds)
FROM <http://localhost:8890/localdata2>
WHERE {
  ?s a asset:Host.
  ?s rdfs:label ?hostName.
  ?s asset:ipAddress ?ip.
  ?s asset:hasProduct ?p.
  SERVICE <http://sepses.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/sparql> {
    ?cve cve:hasCPE ?p .
    ?cve cve:id ?cveId.
    ?p cpe:title ?product .
  }
}
GROUP BY ?hostName ?ip ?product
```

**Example Results:**

| hostName | IP | product | cveIds |
|----------|-------|---------|---------|
| DBServer1 | 192.168.1.3 | Windows Server 2016 | CVE-2016-3332, ..., CVE-2017-8746 |
| Workstation1 | 192.168.1.1 | Windows 10 | CVE-2016-3302, ..., CVE-2015-2554 |

**Key Benefit:** As new vulnerability information becomes available and is automatically integrated into the knowledge graph, query results automatically reflect newly identified vulnerabilities.

#### Query 2: Assessing Critical Vulnerabilities

To assess potential impact of newly identified vulnerabilities, it's critical to determine which data assets might be exposed if successfully exploited. The next query retrieves the most severe vulnerabilities affecting hosts storing sensitive private data with complete confidentiality impact.

**Example Query:**
```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?hostName ?cveId
  ?confidentiality as ?conf ?cvssScore AS ?score 
  ?dataAsset ?classification AS ?class ?consequence
FROM <http://localhost:8890/localdata>
WHERE {
  ?s a asset:Host.
  ?s rdfs:label ?hostName.
  ?s asset:hasProduct ?product.
  ?s asset:hasDataAsset ?dt.
  ?dt rdfs:label ?dataAsset.
  ?dt asset:hasClassification ?c.
  ?c rdfs:label ?classification.
  ?c asset:dataClassificationValue ?cv
  FILTER (?confidentiality = "COMPLETE")
  FILTER (?cv = 1)
  SERVICE <http://sepses.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/sparql> {
    ?cve cve:hasCPE ?product .
    ?cve cve:id ?cveId.
    ?cve cve:hasCVSS2BaseMetric ?cvss2.
    ?cvss2 cvss:confidentialityImpact ?confidentiality.
    ?cvss2 cvss:baseScore ?cvssScore.
    ?cve cwe:hasCWE ?cwe.
    ?cwe cwe:hasCommonConsequence ?cc.
    ?cc cwe:consequenceImpact ?consequence
  }
}
```

**Example Results:**

| hostName | cveId | conf | score | dataAsset | class | consequence |
|----------|-------|------|-------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Workstation2 | 2016-1646 | COMPLETE | 9.3 | EmpData | Private | Read Memory |
| Workstation2 | 2016-1653 | COMPLETE | 9.3 | EmpData | Private | DoS: Crash, Exit... |
| Workstation2 | 2016-1583 | COMPLETE | 7.2 | EmpData | Private | DoS: Resource Cons... |
| Workstation2 | 2016-1583 | COMPLETE | 9.3 | EmpData | Private | Execute Unauthorized... |

**Key Benefit:** Immediate analysis saves time by avoiding manual investigation steps.

#### Exploration

Query results serve as starting points for further Linked Data exploration. By navigating the knowledge graph, security analysts can access:
- Attack prerequisites and potential mitigations from CAPEC
- Weakness classifications and potential mitigations from CWE
- Scorings from CVSS

Example resource: https://w3id.org/sepses/resource/cve/CVE-2016-1646

### 5.2 Intrusion Detection

This scenario illustrates how alerts from the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) Snort can be connected to the SEPSES Cybersecurity KG to obtain deeper understanding of potential threats and ongoing attacks.

#### Integration Steps

1. **Rule Set Integration:**
   - Acquired Snort community rule set
   - Integrated into cybersecurity repository using defined vocabulary
   - Snort monitors rules and triggers alerts on pattern matches in network traffic

2. **Data Modeling:**
   - `SnortRules` represented as class with two linked concepts:
     - `SnortRuleHeader`
     - `SnortRuleOption`
   - `SnortRuleOption` includes properties:
     - `sr:hasClassType`
     - `sr:hasCVEReference` (used to link alerts to CVEs)

#### Setting

**Dataset:** Large dataset from MACCDC 2012 cybersecurity competition providing realistic real-world intrusion detection alerts

**Example Alert:**
```
[**] [1:1807:12] WEB-MISC Chunked-Encoding transfer attempt [**]
[Classification: Web Application Attack] [Priority: 1]
11/10-11:10:12.321349 10.2.189.248:54208 -> 154.241.88.201:80
TCP TTL:61 TOS:0x0 ID:36462 IpLen:20 DgmLen:1200 DF
***A**** Seq: 0xCFAD1EE0 Ack: 0xB27D1032 Win: 0xB7 TcpLen: 32
TCP Options (3) => NOP NOP TS: 2592976 143157138
```

**Vocabulary:** Snort alert log vocabulary used to map alerts into RDF

#### Query: Alert Contextualization

When a Snort alert is triggered, security experts must analyze relevance and decide on potential mitigations. False positives are common. For instance, a particular attack pattern may be detected frequently but may not be relevant if the targeted host configuration is not vulnerable.

To support security analysts in this time-critical task:
1. Identify the corresponding Snort rule that triggered each alert
2. Rules often include CVE references
3. Query knowledge graph for detailed CVE information related to alert
4. Match installed software on host to vulnerable product configuration in CVE
5. Provide better foundation for estimating alert relevance to protected assets

**Example Query:**
```sparql
PREFIX cve: <http://w3id.org/sepses/vocab/ref/cve#>
PREFIX cpe: <http://w3id.org/sepses/vocab/ref/cpe#>
PREFIX snort: <http://w3id.org/sepses/vocab/ref/snort#>
PREFIX snort-rule: <http://w3id.org/sepses/vocab/rule/snort#>
PREFIX snort-alert: <http://w3id.org/sepses/vocab/log/snort-alert#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?alert ?message ?sid ?sourceIp ?destinationIp ?cveId ?cpeId
FROM <http://localhost:8890/snortalert>
WHERE {
  ?alert a snort-alert:IDSSnortAlertLogEntry ;
    snort:signatureId ?sid ;
    snort:message ?message ;
    snort:sourceIp ?sourceIp ;
    snort:destinationIp ?destinationIp .
  SERVICE <http://w3id.org/sepses/sparql> {
    ?rule a snort-rule:SnortRule ;
      snort-rule:hasRuleOption ?ruleOption .
    ?ruleOption snort:signatureId ?sid ;
      snort-rule:hasCveReference ?cve .
    ?cve cve:id ?cveId ;
      cve:hasCPE/cpe:id ?cpeId
  }
}
```

**Example Results:**

| alert | message | sid | sourceIP | targetIP | cveId | cpeId |
|-------|---------|-----|----------|----------|-------|-------|
| Alert001 | WEB-MISC Chunked... | 1807 | 10.2.190.254 | 154.241.88.201 | 2002-0392 | cpe:/a:apa... |

**Next Step:** Security analyst can query if the attacked host has the vulnerable software installed (similar to Query 1 in Vulnerability Assessment).

## 6. Conclusions

In this resource paper, we highlight the need for semantically explicit representations of security knowledge and the current lack of interlinked instance data. To tackle this challenge, we present a cybersecurity knowledge graph that integrates a set of widely adopted, heterogeneous cybersecurity data sources.

### Key Achievements

1. **Knowledge Graph Maintenance:** Developed ETL process that updates the graph as new security information becomes available

2. **Public Accessibility:** Multiple services to access the data:
   - SPARQL endpoint
   - Triple pattern fragments interface
   - Linked Data interface
   - Download options for complete dataset and subsets

3. **Demonstrated Usefulness:** Two example use cases in:
   - Vulnerability assessment
   - Semantic interpretation of intrusion detection system alerts

### Expected Impact

Given the compelling need for efficient exchange of machine-interpretable cybersecurity knowledge, we expect the KG to be useful for:
- **Practitioners:** Supporting day-to-day security operations
- **Researchers:** Enabling novel security research applications

The resource should ultimately facilitate innovative semantic security tools and services.

### Future Work

Future work will focus on:
1. **Dissemination:** Spreading adoption in the security domain
2. **Community Building:** Building a community of users and contributors
3. **Knowledge Graph Growth:** Integrating additional security standards and information extracted from:
   - Structured sources
   - Unstructured sources

## Key Takeaways

1. **Integration Challenge Solved:** The SEPSES Knowledge Graph addresses the fragmentation of cybersecurity information by providing a unified, semantically explicit view across multiple standards (CVE, CVSS, CPE, CWE, CAPEC).

2. **Continuous Evolution:** Automated ETL pipeline ensures the knowledge graph stays current with the rapidly changing cybersecurity landscape, with different polling strategies for different source update frequencies.

3. **Practical Applications:** Demonstrated usefulness through vulnerability assessment and intrusion detection use cases, showing how the KG can contextualize local security information with global threat intelligence.

4. **Accessibility:** Multiple access mechanisms (SPARQL, TPF, Linked Data, downloads) cater to different use cases and technical requirements.

5. **Sustainability:** Strong institutional support from TU Wien and SBA Research, combined with open-source approach, ensures long-term viability and community engagement.

6. **Scale:** Over 36 million triples and 500,000+ instances provide comprehensive coverage of cybersecurity knowledge as of publication.

7. **Semantic Web Application:** Demonstrates practical application of Linked Data principles in a highly dynamic, mission-critical domain.
